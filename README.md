# what2eat

"what2eat" (stylized in all lowercase, with "to" stylized as the number 2 to make the name of the application both easy to remember and unique) is a very simple food application that is designed to give users an idea of what they want to eat. This project is being done in accordance with Saint Leo University's Mobile Application Design class.

# Detailed Description

This section will serve to better explain the application and how it will work, or at least the design plans for this application. While I would like for this application to be fairly advanced in what it searches, including being able to pinpoint restaurants, grocery stores, and fresh markets near the user using a GPS system, I do not currently have the technological know-how to make this happen. For that reason, this application will suggest different foods and where one might be able to find them. For example, if the application determines the user wants a burger, it will suggest buying the ingredients for that meal from a nearby fresh market, grocery store, or suggest going to a fast food restaurant such as McDonald's, which can be found in most locations.

# How It Works

How this application will work is retrieving a food suggestion based on a few different options that will be given to the user. Each of these options will be explained below. It should be noted that while this application is still in these early stages, each option will only support a few possible choices, even though the user will be able to enter in their own data in each field.

// Option 1 - Preferences 

This option refers to what the user likes to eat in general, such as their favorite foods, or things that they never get tired of. While the application serves to present new options, this can help in knowing the general flavors that the user likes to eat.

Preferences will only have a few options in this stage of the application:

- Pizza - related to "Italian food"
- Burgers - related to "American food"
- Noodles - related to "Chinese food"
- BBQ - related to "Southern food"
- Seafood - related to "Japanese food"

Each of these relations will help determine what kind of food the application retrieves. These relations will be explained more later on and will exist within a database. These relations are the backbone of the application and control how it works.

// Option 2 - Cravings

Cravings are what sorts of flavors sound good. This is sort of hard to explain, but it becomes much clearer when one sees a sample database. This option serves to narrow down what the user might be interested in eating.

[Spicy]
- if "Chinese food" then "Kung Pao Chicken" or "Spicy Fried Rice"
- if "American food" then "Jalapeno Cheeseburger" or "Stuffed Peppers"
- if "Italian food" then "Penne Arrabbiata" or "Caprese Salad"
- if "Southern food" then "Ghoulash" or "Spicy Collards"
- if "Japanese food" then "Japanese curry" or "Spicy tofu"

[Sweet]
- if "Chinese food" then
- if "American food" then
- if "Italian food" then
- if "Southern food" then
- if "Japanese food" then

[Sour]
- if "Chinese food" then
- if "American food" then
- if "Italian food" then
- if "Southern food" then
- if "Japanese food" then

[Exotic]
- if "Chinese food" then
- if "American food" then
- if "Italian food" then
- if "Southern food" then
- if "Japanese food" then

// Option 3 - Allergies

# The Problem Being Addressed 



      My project is a simple food application that helps somebody find out what they want to eat. Because I do not have the know-how or technological capability or funding to create an application like this that would do exactly as I wanted (as in, the application would function off GPS and work in every city), I would simplify it for the purpose of this project. The name of this application would be "what2eat."

      The simplified version of this application would simply return a list of generic options (rather than specific restaurants and stores) based on the preferences, cravings, and allergies entered in by the user. These items are described shortly below:

Preferences: What do you like to eat in general? Do you have any favorite foods, or anything you never get tired of? These sorts of options would be here.

Cravings: What sounds good to you, what sort of flavor are you craving? Do you want something spicy, sweet, a pasta, maybe fine dining options?

Allergies: Any allergies the user has so the application does not recommend choices they are allergic to. This is a QoL feature so that the application does not make the user hungry for something they can’t have.

•	Problem addressing

     The problem this application aims to address is that many people cannot decide what they want to eat. Maybe they wish to try something new, or they are simply just unable to pick between the options they have availible to them. This application will help with that by obtaining a list of options that would help the user pick what they wanted to eat.
