# what2eat
A plan for an application that helps assist in choosing what to eat.

•	Project description

      My project is a simple food application that helps somebody find out what they want to eat. Because I do not have the know-how or technological capability or funding to create an application like this that would do exactly as I wanted (as in, the application would function off GPS and work in every city), I would simplify it for the purpose of this project. The name of this application would be "what2eat."

      The simplified version of this application would simply return a list of generic options (rather than specific restaurants and stores) based on the preferences, cravings, and allergies entered in by the user. These items are described shortly below:

Preferences: What do you like to eat in general? Do you have any favorite foods, or anything you never get tired of? These sorts of options would be here.

Cravings: What sounds good to you, what sort of flavor are you craving? Do you want something spicy, sweet, a pasta, maybe fine dining options?

Allergies: Any allergies the user has so the application does not recommend choices they are allergic to. This is a QoL feature so that the application does not make the user hungry for something they can’t have.

•	Problem addressing

     The problem this application aims to address is that many people cannot decide what they want to eat. Maybe they wish to try something new, or they are simply just unable to pick between the options they have availible to them. This application will help with that by obtaining a list of options that would help the user pick what they wanted to eat.
